## RequireJS + Karma + QUnit + Coverage + JUnit

It is set up so that you can run the tests via karma (using Chrome by default) but also run them using a qunit test page.

To run the qunit test page open `test/qunit_suite/test.html` in a browser.

To run using karma run the following commands:
```
npm install
npm test
```
